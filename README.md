Python code to run the results from Self-Calibration and Metric Reconstruction Paper: https://www.cs.unc.edu/~marc/pubs/PollefeysIJCV99.pdf

main file is `cameraIntrinsicsPipeline.py`


I spent too long trying to figure out the paper and mapping it to code, my hope is that anyone who might wanna play around with this can use it. 

Note: you might have to edit paths and download the SINTEL/Flying Things datasets separately 


Report that shows results is [here](https://johanos.com/static/media/cos529-report.157f3a33f48a74355760.pdf) (check johanos.com if this link get's out of date)
